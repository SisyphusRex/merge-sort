# Merge Sort
## What Is
Divides an array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.  
An array of size 1 is sorted and the base case.
After two arrays size 1 are obtained from partitioning, the arrays are merged together:  
  Merging involves repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the two arrays to form combined sorted array.
Progressively larger sorted arrays are merged together.
